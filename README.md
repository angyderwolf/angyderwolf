- 👋 Hi, I'm @angyderwolf
- 👀 I'm interested in learning and sharing brand new codes, so people can have an easier time while solving problems.
- 🌱 I’m currently studying an engenieering.
- 💞️ I’m looking to help people, as we as coders should share our code.
- Please, if you're willing to read my codes, select "Raw", as I have uploaded them as .ipynb. :) <3
